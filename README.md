This portfolio entry is for CS 255 System Design &amp; Analysis. It contains a business requirements document as well as a system design document for DriverPass' online driving lesson and test system.

<b>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</b>

The DriverPass project was born when the members of DriverPass noticed there was an increase in driving test failures, likely due to inadequate preparation and training. They saw an opportunity to create a convenient online training program to give aspiring drivers the knowledge and experience necessary to acquire their driver's license. They wanted a system that provided online training sessions and tests, in-person driving lessons, and easy progress tracking for their users. They wanted to offer different training packages so that there was proper training for individuals with differing schedule and budget constraints.

<b>What did you do particularly well?</b>

I think I identified the requirements needed for the project and documented them pretty well. By making use of several diagrams, charts, and other documents, I was able to design the system with the client's needs in mind. I think when all was said and done, I captured a good description of the system and how it should behave.

<b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b>

After reviewing the documents and giving it a lot of thought, I think I would revise the system design document, specifically the class diagram. I would have been more detailed with my classes. For example, the Admin will be responsible for much more than I showed in my diagram, which was overseeing report generation. They will be responsible for managing user accounts, traning packages, security measures, and activity logs just to name a few. If I could revise my diagram, I would capture the role of the Admin more comprehensively. As it stands, the diagram gives a nice high level overview of the objects of the system and their attributes, but it could be improved with some added detail and granularity.

<b>How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?</b>

My interpretation of the user's needs was largely based on the interview transcript. Having a direct meeting with the client and asking the proper questions is, in my opinion, the best way to understand what exactly the client wants. There are many ways to gather system requirements, like observation and data collection, but there is no substitute for direct communication with the client.

It's important to consider the needs of the user because at the end of the day, if the system doesn't cater to the user's needs, the system has failed. The users are the ones who will be interacting with the system, so their experience should be a pleasant one that enables them to accomplish their goals with as little hassle as possible.

<b>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</b>

This course has taught me the importance of proper requirements gathering; making sure that you know exactly what the client wants before jumping into development. So in future projects, I'll consider who the system is for, what needs do the client and the users have. I'll communicate with the client extensively, starting with an initial interview, asking them questions and getting all the information from them that I can. I'll maintain close contact with them throughout the analysis and design phases of the project, having regular meetings making sure that we're staying on track as the system starts getting fleshed out.
